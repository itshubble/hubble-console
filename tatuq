    Implemented the View Plans page.
    
    This page was derived from the View Accounts page by making appropriate modifications.
    The `fetchPlansComplete()` and `fetchPlans()` action creators were introduced to fetch
    the plans from the backend. The `plansReducer()` function updates the store with
    the plans fetched from the backend.
    
    The `WorkspaceFilter` component was removed from the View Plans page. Further, the
    `WorkspaceTable` now accepts a `rowsPerPage` prop.

    Implemented the View Subscriptions page.
    
    This page was derived from the View Accounts page by making appropriate modifications.
    The rows in the `WorkspaceTable` component were rendered specifically for accounts.
    In order to make to generic, the `WorkspaceTable` was updated to accept the `renderCellValue`
    prop, a callback function responsible for rendering the cell. This modification has caused the
    View Accounts page to crash the application. This issue will be fixed shortly.

    Updated `SubscriptionFormDialog` to be more flexible.
    
    Since the `NewSubscription` component could be reused for editing subscriptions, it was renamed to
    `SubscriptionFormDialog`.
    
    The internal state of this component was significantly modified in this commit. Previously a two
    dimensional array was used to keep track of all the values. Now we use key-value pairs. This change
    was made to keep up with the `RecordForm`. However, the shape of the form state is somewhat
    transparent because we use `extractValues` exported by the `RecordForm.js` module, which takes
    care of extracting the default state based on the form configuration.

    The `saveAccount()` asynchronous action creator dispatches the `FETCH_ACCOUNT_COMPLETE` action on
    receving response from the server. Thus, the fields in View Account page is automatically updated.

    AccountFormDialog is injected with the values of the account being edited.
    
    The state of the AccountFormDialog component was significantly modified in this commit.
    Previously, a two dimensional array was used to keep track of all the values. However,
    now we use key-value pairs. RecordForm was modified to keep up with these changes.
    In doing so, the functionality of the other add dialogs were obstructed.
    
    The `EditAccount` component is a simple container that renders AccountFormDialog with
    appropriate callbacks. We could have done the same within the bounds of `MainLayout`.
    However, that would have meant for the layout to be tightly coupled with all the
    dialogs it renders. Therefore, the functionality was abstracted into `EditAccount`.
    Similar abstractions will be created shortly.

    The Edit button in the AccountCard component now opens the Edit Account dialog.
    
    The `editAccount()` action creator dispatches the `EDIT_ACCOUNT` action with the
    account as payload. The `openDialogReducer` prepares the store for rendering the
    dialog and `accountReducer` stores the account to edit.

    Clear account from the store when the screen changes.
    
    The View Account page renders a circular progress when the account in the store is null. However,
    if the store has an account from a previous visit to the page, it temporarily renders the stale
    account. This may confuse the user. Therefore, the account is cleared from the store when the
    user leaves the page.

    Linked View Accounts and View Account pages.
    
    When the user click on a row in View Accounts page the View Account page is opened with the identifier
    of the account. View Account page then makes a REST API call to fetch the account details and render
    it. This required introduction of an asynchronous action and a reducer.
    
    The behavior of the WorkspaceTable component had be changed to accomodate this. The row checkbox
    uses a different handler than the other cells. Right now, each cell receives a event handler.
    There was an issue with using just two handlers: one for checkbox and another one for the whole
    row. However, this did not work because of some event propogation logic that I am not able to
    figure out.
    
    A bug was found and fixed in the mock backend. Basically, the first capture returned by `Regex.exec()`,
    is the regex itself. Previously, the first capture was being used as the identifier parameter.

    Two utility functions, `soonDate()` and `pastDate()`, were added to create random ISO date strings.
    The documentation of Faker.js specifies that `faker.date.soon()` is exported. However, on inspecting
    the module, it appears that `soon()` is not available. I think we are using an older version of
    Faker.js. We may want to update this in the future. Right now, `soonDate()` returns a future date.

    Created the "View Accounts" page.
    
    The `ViewAccounts` component loads the accounts by dispatching the asynchronous `fetchAccounts()`
    action. The `showNotification()` and `fetchAccountsComplete()` actions are dispatched at the end
    and beginning, respectively, after the data is fetched. The corresponding reducers were added
    to update the shape of the store.
    
    The `WorkspaceTable`, `WorkspaceTableToolbar` and `WorkspaceTableHead` occupy the majority of the
    `ViewAccounts` page. These components are generic enough such that other workspace pages can make
    use of them.

    Updated the main layout to display notifications.
    
    Currently there are two types of notifications: loading and success. The latter is shown indefinitely.

    "New Account" dialog invokes `createAccount` action creator on save.
    
    The Redux Thunk and Axios packages were added as dependencies. The `createAccount()` action creator
    makes a REST API call via Axios to create an account on the server. It dispatches a notification at
    the beginning and the end of the request. Therefore, the required action creators and reducers for
    showing notifications were added.
    
    The `RecordForm` component was updated to invoke a listener provided by the parent component,
    mostly a controller, to notify whenever the fields are modified by the user. Further, it now
    requires a `values` prop which contains the current values of the fields. The parent component
    is responsible for extracting these values from the `groups` props that describes the layout
    of the form. A utility function `extractValues()` was added for this purpose.

    Added the boilerplate code for working with React Redux.
    
    When the user tries to create new records or configurations via Quick Add, the
    dialog now fires an action that is handled by a reducer. A dummy New Account form
    was created to test this.

    Added dummy pages and the quick add dialog.
    
    The quick add dialog provides users with a shortcut to add records and configurations.
    Internally, it will make use of Redux to bring up the requested screen.

    Added a navigation drawer to the main layout.
    
    The navigation drawer is the primary way to navigate through the various screens in Hubble.
    The content is wrapped in the `main` element. The left and top margins of the `main`
    element are adjusted such that the drawer and toolbar do not overlap the content. Currently,
    the margins are hardcoded. This should be updated to be dynamic.

    As of now, the routes cannot change dynamically.

    Updated the main layout and implemented the main toolbar.
    
    The main toolbar is currently dark. With the logo being dark, it looks awkward on the toolbar.
    Once Redux is integrated, we can ue the app theme to render the toolbar light.

    The Material UI and React Router packages were added to the dependencies. We are yet to make use of
    them.
